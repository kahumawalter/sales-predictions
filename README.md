# Sales Pedictions

Data Exploration, Data cleaning, Visualization and Machine Learning models like linear Regression to make predictions

# An overview of the project
The project goes through different ways of data cleaning, imputation, visualization and how data can be predicted using machine learning models like linear regression. 

# Relevant insights from the data.
Some of the data was visualized with heat map which helped show the correlation between the different data provided.

The data was cleaned and this helped to create an efficient train_test_split that would stop data leakage in the machine learning model

# Summary of the model and its evaluation metrics

Having sampled different models, I chose to go with Decision Tree Regressor for prediction. The evaluated model which was computed with the R Squared Score gave me an output of 0.22 which translates into 22%, meaning that the model can explain 22% of the variation in the target.

At the end, no one metric told the whole story. It was just important to examine and understand multiple metrics for each model.
